# üçï DeliveryApp's main screen

#### This project is an implementation of a delivery app's main screen with food categories, your city selector, and ad banners. I've built it for learning purposes and to refresh my knowledge of the VIPER pattern. The app focuses on both responsiveness and implementation of business logic. I am currently implementing a loading state for menu items and a data caching service to reuse images.
#### Tutorial on how to implement this app is in development.

## üì¶ Technologies:

* `UIKit`
* `VIPER`
* `CoreData`
* `File Manager`
* `Unit Testing`
* `Networking`
* [`Spoonacular API`](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)

## üö¶ Running the Project

To run the project on your device, follow these steps:

* I haven't optimized the layout for all screen sizes, so I advise using the iPhone 15 Pro simulator.
* This project doesn't use any third-party libraries, so just build it and it should work.
