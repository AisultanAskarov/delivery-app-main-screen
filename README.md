# üçï DeliveryApp's main screen

#### This project is an implementation of a delivery app's main screen with food categories, your city selector, and ad banners. I've built it for learning purposes and to refresh my knowledge of the VIPER pattern. The app focuses on both responsiveness and implementation of business logic. The project has a two-stage caching system implemented to store and later reuse images and menu items. Menu item cells have a shimmer effect loading state, and all the networking services and caching services are covered by unit testing.
#### Tutorial on how to implement this app is in development.
